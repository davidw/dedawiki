== DedaWiki

I created DedaWiki in a serious bout of "NIH" (Not Invented Here)
which came to a head when I kept running into problems getting Instiki
to work.

DedaWiki is my vision of what a wiki ought to be like, and was created
with the express purpose of hosting a site of mine,
http://www.leenooks.com.

It is distributed under the very liberal Apache Software License,
which means that you have the right to integrate this code into
proprietary applications if you so desire.
