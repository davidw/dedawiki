== DedaWiki

I created DedaWiki in a serious bout of "NIH" (Not Invented Here)
which came to a head when I kept running into problems getting Instiki
to work.

DedaWiki is my vision of what a wiki ought to be like, and was created
with the express purpose of hosting a site of mine,
http://www.leenooks.com.

It is distributed under the very liberal Apache Software License,
which means that you have the right to integrate this code into
proprietary applications if you so desire.

== Installation

  1. Create a database (dedawiki_production, for example), and
     configure config/database.yml to point to it.

  2. Go to http://YOURSITE/setup to configure the site and initial
     user, who is also the site admin.

== IMPORTANT

Since I no longer run Leenooks.com, and don't really need this system
anymore, I've shut down the example site and have mothballed the
project.
